### load packages (install first if the PC doesn't have them installed)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(igraph)

### load data
 
    ### find the VC Data file on my github: https://github.com/CarlHindsgaul/VC-Investor-Network)
    ### now download it and modify the path in the script so your downloaded file is loaded as the dataframe

data <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\carlw\\Mit drev\\2nd Year Project\\VC Data.xlsx")

### restructure data so each row represents and "edge" (connection between investor and company)

edge_list <- data %>%
  mutate(Investors = strsplit(as.character(Investors), ", ")) %>%
  unnest(Investors) %>% 
  separate(Investors, c("Investor", "InvestorCountry"), " \\(") %>% 
  mutate(InvestorCountry = gsub("\\)", "", InvestorCountry))


### restructure edge_list to a binary incidence matrix, which is useful for network analysis
  
    ### first make a new dataframe with only edgelist variables (company and investor)

edge_list_excl <- edge_list %>%
  select(Investor, Company)

    ### now make the actual incidence matrix. We need to create an igraph object, i.e. a network-analysis object. 
    ### the iGraph object requires a list of nodes and the type of each node.

        ### we only want the unique names. In the edge_list, each company and investor (each 'vertex') can appear several times.

vertex_list <- unique(c(edge_list_excl$Company, edge_list_excl$Investor))

        ### we also want to have a information about whether each node/name is a company or an investor.

vertex_types <- ifelse(vertex_list %in% edge_list_excl$Company, TRUE, FALSE)

        ### we now create the igraph object, let us call it "g", and convert it into an incidence matrix.

g <- graph_from_data_frame(edge_list_excl, directed = FALSE, vertices = data.frame(name = vertex_list, type = vertex_types))

incidence_matrix <- as_incidence_matrix(g, sparse = FALSE)
print(incidence_matrix)

    ### add the incidence matrix as a dataframe (you can use the link from my github, which is simply a .csv export of the incidence_matrix generated above) 

MatrixData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarlHindsgaul/VC-Investor-Network/main/incidence_matrix.csv")

### we can now make network analysis
